<h3>Donating to the project</h3>

<p>
You can support the project by donating to the development team. There is no
minimum amount, you can give just what you want.
</p>

<p>
The money received is mainly used to buy time to the development team. When
donating, you can also vote for a bug or a feature you'd like to see in the
next release.
</p>

<p>
It can also be used by the development team for paying travel
costs during Perl conferences, where Dancer would be presented.
